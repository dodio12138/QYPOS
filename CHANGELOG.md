## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Staff Management**: Employee CRUD, schedules, attendance tracking, and hourly wage.
- **Staff Scheduling**: Weekly schedule planner with drag-and-drop time presets, actual attendance recording, and revenue-per-hour conversion metrics.
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Fine-grained cashier-specific permission sets; service charge adjustment/exemption, discount, and order cancellation all require explicit permissions.
- **POS Login Gate**: All front-desk operations (open table, add items, print, take payment, clear table) now require staff authentication.
- **Order Confirmation**: Confirmation step before opening a dine-in table or creating a takeaway order to prevent accidental taps.
- **Dojo Go Terminal Integration**: Pay-at-Counter support via Dojo Go payment terminals (Payment Intent + terminal session lifecycle).
- **Strict Printer Routing**: Kitchen/receipt printers now fail explicitly when the assigned printer is missing, disabled, or has no IP — no silent fallback.
- **New-Items-Only Kitchen Print Locking**: Only newly added items are locked and printed; already-printed items are never re-sent to the kitchen.
- **Top-Seller Drilldown**: Dashboard top sellers now support multi-select with merged trend charts, compatible with historical data missing `item_id`.
- **Report Enhancements**: Day-of-week multi-select filter; expanded date presets (today, yesterday, last 7/30 days, this month, this week, last week, last month).
- **Full i18n**: Complete Chinese / English coverage across POS and Admin interfaces.
- **ESLint Configuration**: Root-level flat config with `no-undef` rule integrated into CI pipeline to catch prop-passing regressions.
- **Audit Log Filters**: Combined user, action, and exact time-range filters in Admin audit log view.
- **Sensitive Settings Re-authentication**: Tax rate changes now require current-account PIN confirmation.
- **Order Pagination**: Admin order list paginates at 20 items per page.

### Fixed
- **DST Timezone Bug**: Item trend chart date axis now aligns with main report dates — no longer off by one day during Daylight Saving Time.
- **`locale` Prop Crashes**: Multiple components (`PosLogin`, `DiscountAdminModal`, `SettingsView`, etc.) that crashed with `ReferenceError: locale is not defined` due to missing prop declarations/passing — all fixed and guarded by ESLint.
- **Discount Cap**: Discount amount is now capped to the order subtotal, preventing negative or anomalous totals.

### Changed
- **Payment Validation**: Payment amount must be > 0, change cannot be negative, and closed orders reject duplicate payments.
- **Backup Scheduling**: Manual backup, auto-backup scheduling, backup file list, and download now available from the Admin Operations panel.
